## Introduction

**Data leakage** happens when information used to train or evaluate a model contains data that would not be available at prediction time. Consequences include:

- **Overoptimistic Metrics:** Inflated performance in validation, hiding real-world issues.
- **Poor Generalization:** Model fails to perform on truly unseen data.
- **Privacy & Compliance Risks:** Unintended exposure of sensitive or proprietary information.

Understanding and preventing data leakage is crucial for building reliable ML and LLM systems.

## Data Leakage in Traditional ML

### Definition & Types

1. **Feature Leakage**: Features inadvertently include information derived from the target or future events (e.g., using next month's sales to predict current revenue).  
2. **Target Leakage**: Direct use of the target, or a proxy thereof, as an input feature (e.g., including `is_fraud_flag` when predicting fraud).

#### Common Subtypes:
- **Temporal Leakage**: Future timestamps or values leak into training (time-series models).  
- **Aggregation Leakage**: Global statistics (mean, max) computed on complete dataset instead of only training split.  
- **Data Merge Leakage**: Joining datasets without care, leaking labels across records.

### Examples & Consequences

| Scenario                              | Leakage Type        | Root Cause                                     | Impact                                     |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Churn prediction using `days_active`  | Temporal            | `days_active` counts days until churn event    | Unrealistically high accuracy              |
| Income model using overall `avg_income` | Aggregation         | Computed across train+val+test                 | Model learns dataset-wide average          |
| Fraud detection with `fraud_flag`     | Target              | Post-event flag used as input                  | Trivial perfect classification             |

> **Consequence:** Even simple models (e.g., linear regression) can appear flawless but collapse in production, undermining trust.

### Detection & Prevention

- **Data Pipeline Audits:** Review each feature transformation—ensure no target- or future-derived data is used.  
- **Isolated Splitting:** Perform train/val/test splits before any preprocessing; fit scalers or encoders on train only.  
- **Feature Importance Checks:** Unexpectedly high feature importances often flag leakage.  
- **Leakage Smoke Tests:** Train a model using a single suspect feature—if it yields >90% accuracy, inspect for leakage.

## Data Leakage in LLM Training

### Why LLMs Are Vulnerable

- **Massive Capacity:** Can memorize and regurgitate lengthy passages.  
- **Diverse Data Sources:** Aggregation of web data, books, code, forums increases overlap risk.  
- **Multi-Stage Training:** Pretraining + fine-tuning + feedback loops create multiple leakage opportunities.

### Forms of Leakage

1. **Pretraining–Evaluation Overlap**: Benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, TruthfulQA) present in pretraining corpus.  
2. **Instruction-Tuning Leakage**: Models fine-tuned on community-generated Q&A that includes benchmark questions.  
3. **Feedback Loop Contamination**: Using production user queries/responses as new training data without sanitization.

### Real-World Case Studies

- **GPT-2 (Carlini et al., 2022):** Extracted private emails and code snippets stored verbatim in model.  
- **Stanford Alpaca:** Reported high GSM8K accuracy due to evaluation questions appearing in instruction-tuning data.

### Detection & Prevention Techniques

## Validation Strategies Without Full CV

When full k-fold cross-validation is impractical (large data/models), adopt these strategies:

- **Holdout with Stratification**: `train_test_split(..., stratify=y)` preserves class imbalance ratios.  
- **Group/Time-Based Splits**: Respect grouping factors (e.g., user IDs) or temporal order to prevent leakage.  
- **Bootstrap Sampling**: Generate multiple pseudo-train/test splits cheaply to estimate variance.

> _Review this cheat sheet along with the detailed sections above for a quick yet thorough understanding of data leakage challenges and solutions in ML and LLM contexts._

1. What is data leakage in machine learning?
Answer:

Data leakage occurs when information from outside the training dataset is used to create the model. This causes the model to perform unrealistically well during training/validation, but poorly in production.
In LLMs, data leakage typically refers to:

Memorization of training data
Evaluation data being included during pretraining or finetuning
Indirect leakage via overlapping examples

2. How does data leakage affect LLMs specifically?
Answer:

Large Language Models can memorize parts of their training data, especially when the data is repeated, low-entropy (e.g., code, lists, QA pairs), or high-frequency.
If that same data is used for evaluation, it will give inflated accuracy and false sense of generalization.
Examples:

If the test prompt "What is the capital of France?" was seen during pretraining → the model appears to “know” it
Leaked evaluation datasets (like MMLU, HELM, TruthfulQA) used during training → misleading benchmark results

3. What are common sources of data leakage in LLM pipelines?
Answer:

Including evaluation benchmarks in the pretraining or fine-tuning corpus
Overlapping training and validation examples due to poor deduplication
Including user-provided production data back into training (e.g., fine-tuning on data with evaluation prompts)
Reusing instruction tuning datasets without sanitizing their origin

4. How do we detect and prevent data leakage in LLM training?
Answer: ✅ Best practices include:

SHA-based de-duplication across pretraining and eval corpora
Using Bloom filters or hashing to track overlaps
Keeping test benchmarks strictly isolated
Tracking data provenance: know where each document came from
Memorization testing: prompt the model with known training samples and observe verbatim generation

5. What are memorization attacks and how are they related to leakage?
Answer:

A memorization attack is when an adversary extracts private or sensitive data from a trained model.
This happens when the model has overfitted to certain training examples.
Examples include:

GPT-2 generating private emails or code snippets from GitHub
LLaMA 2 emitting training samples verbatim under specific prompts
Leakage → Memorization → Privacy Risk

6. Is all memorization bad?
Answer:

Not necessarily.
Memorizing public facts (e.g., "Paris is the capital of France") is useful and often expected.
But memorizing:
Sensitive data (e.g., passwords, PII, medical notes)
Evaluation samples
…is problematic.

So the goal is to minimize unintentional and sensitive memorization.

7. How can we evaluate if our LLM is suffering from data leakage?
Answer: You can:

Use "canary strings" during training and check if the model reproduces them
Check exact match of evaluation prompts in training set
Run extraction probes (e.g., membership inference or verbatim completion)
Use tools like:
ExactMatch (for overlap detection)
DataPerf for benchmarking evaluation integrity

8. How do companies like OpenAI or Google prevent data leakage?
Answer: They usually:

Maintain a strict separation of evaluation and training sets
Use hashing, deduplication, and canary detection
Design held-out datasets during pretraining
Periodically audit their corpora and evaluation datasets

9. How can instruction tuning introduce leakage?
Answer: If you fine-tune your model on open-source datasets like ShareGPT, OASST, or Alpaca, and then evaluate it on benchmarks like GSM8K or MMLU (which those datasets might contain), you are:

Evaluating on data your model has already seen in training — even if indirectly.
This gives overly optimistic performance.

10. What are some real-world cases of LLM data leakage?
Answer:

GPT-2 showing training text snippets with rare names
Stanford’s Alpaca being trained on self-instruct prompts which contained benchmark samples
Models like Pythia being probed to regenerate training data with high fidelity
