# Efficient LLM Training on a Single Accelerator

Training large language models typically requires distributing computation across many GPUs or TPUs. However, with careful engineering and optimization, you can train scaled-down or distilled variants on a single accelerator. This document covers key techniques and concepts, along with a detailed Q&A section for interviews.

## ðŸ”§ Key Techniques for Efficient LLM Training on a Single Accelerator

### 1. Mixed-Precision Training (FP16/BF16)

**Concept:**
- Reduce memory usage and speed up training by using 16-bit floating point numbers (FP16 or BF16) instead of 32-bit floats (FP32).

**How it works:**
- The forward and backward passes run in half-precision.
- Parameter updates (e.g., in Adam) are performed in full precision (FP32) to avoid numerical instability.

**Tools & Frameworks:**
- PyTorch: `torch.cuda.amp.autocast()` and `GradScaler()`
- TensorFlow: `tf.keras.mixed_precision`

---

### 2. Gradient Checkpointing (Activation Checkpointing)

**Concept:**
- Instead of storing all intermediate activations during the forward pass, recompute them during the backward pass.

**Benefits:**
- Reduces memory usage by up to 50%.

**Trade-off:**
- Slightly more compute due to extra forward passes.

**Tools:**
- PyTorch: `torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint`
- DeepSpeed: Built-in support for activation checkpointing

---

### 3. Memory-Efficient Optimizers

**8-bit Optimizers:**
- Optimizers like Adam store running averages. Converting these to 8-bit saves a lot of memory.

**Examples:**
- `bitsandbytes` for 8-bit Adam

**Flash Attention:**
- A more efficient implementation of attention layers with reduced memory overhead.

**Frameworks:**
- DeepSpeed ZeRO-Offload (balances memory usage between GPU and CPU)

---

### 4. Batch Size and Gradient Accumulation

**Gradient Accumulation:**
- Accumulate gradients over `N` micro-batches before updating the model.
- Simulates large batch training on limited hardware.

**Why it's important:**
- Helps achieve better generalization without exceeding GPU memory.

---

### 5. Model Parallelism Variants

**Tensor Parallelism:**
- Split tensors in large layers (e.g., matrix multiplies) across cores of a single GPU (with NVLink/NVSwitch).

**Pipeline Parallelism:**
- Split model layers sequentially and reuse GPU memory via activation checkpointing.

**1D/2D Parallelism:**
- Sophisticated sharding techniques used in frameworks like Megatron-LM.

---

### 6. Optimized Data Loading

**Prefetching and Caching:**
- Asynchronously load and prepare batches while the model is training on the current batch.

**Sharding:**
- Break large datasets into smaller chunks to avoid loading everything into memory.

**Streaming:**
- Stream data on-the-fly from disk or cloud.

---

### 7. Profiling and Tuning

**Tools:**
- `torch.cuda.memory_summary()`
- `nvprof`, `Nsight Systems`, `TensorBoard`

**Performance Tips:**
- Use `torch.compile()` or `torch.jit` in PyTorch 2.0+
- Tune batch size, sequence length, and activation sizes

## ðŸ¤– What is an Accelerator?

**Accelerators** are specialized hardware devices designed to speed up computation for machine learning workloads.

### Common Accelerators:
- **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):** Parallelism, high memory bandwidth
- **TPU (Tensor Processing Unit):** Google-designed for tensor ops
- **NPU/DSP:** Used in mobile or edge devices

**Why use accelerators?**
- Drastically faster matrix operations
- Handles high-dimensional tensor ops (like attention) efficiently

## ðŸ“š Popular Interview Questions and Answers

### ðŸ”Ž Data Leakage (ML + LLM)

**Q1: What is data leakage?**
- It happens when a model has access to information during training that it wouldn't have during real deployment.

**Q2: How can leakage occur during preprocessing?**
- Example: Scaling your entire dataset before splitting into train/test â€” test data influences training pipeline.

**Q3: What is target leakage?**
- When input features contain data derived from the target variable. E.g., using "payment date" to predict "will the user pay?"

**Q4: How does data leakage occur in LLMs?**
- Including evaluation/test set content (e.g., MMLU or HELM) in pretraining corpus â€” causes memorization.

**Q5: How do you prevent leakage in LLMs?**
- Rigorous deduplication
- Hash matching eval sets against train corpus
- Redacting known benchmark datasets

**Q6: What is label leakage in LLM fine-tuning?**
- If fine-tuning with prompts that include answers or labels directly, the model learns the output pattern instead of reasoning.

### ðŸš€ Efficient Single-Accelerator LLM Training

**Q1: How do you train LLMs on a single GPU?**
- Mixed precision
- Gradient checkpointing
- LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- Streaming data
- Quantized weights

**Q2: What is gradient accumulation?**
- Technique to simulate large batch sizes by splitting and accumulating smaller micro-batches.

**Q3: Why use 8-bit or 4-bit weights or optimizers?**
- Saves memory
- Slight degradation in accuracy, but acceptable trade-off

**Q4: What is LoRA and why is it useful?**
- Efficient fine-tuning method â€” injects trainable matrices into attention layers.
- Only updates a few parameters â†’ lower memory use.

**Q5: What are the main memory bottlenecks in LLM training?**
- Storing hidden activations during forward pass
- Optimizer state (Adam: 3x parameters)
- Large sequences (long context = large tensors)

**Q6: What profiling tools do you use?**
- `torch.cuda.memory_summary()`
- `nvidia-smi`
- `Nsight`, `TensorBoard`, or `wandb`
