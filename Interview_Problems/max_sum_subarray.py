def max_adjusted_increasing_subarray_sum(arr):
    """
    Problem:
    --------
    Given an array of integers, the goal is to select a contiguous subarray and "adjust" 
    its elements so that they form a strictly increasing sequence when read from left to right.
    The adjustment means you can lower an element's value (but not raise it), and the sequence 
    must satisfy: adjusted[i] < adjusted[i+1] for all valid i.
    
    The objective is to maximize the sum of these adjusted values. For example:
      - For arr = [7, 4, 5, 2, 6, 5], one optimal solution is to choose subarray [7, 4, 5] 
        and adjust it to [3, 4, 5] (since 3 < 4 < 5), giving a sum of 12.
      - Alternatively, using the subarray [5, 2, 6, 5] and adjusting it to [1, 2, 4, 5] also gives a sum of 12.
    
    Approach:
    ---------
    1. Iterate over every possible ending index `j` in the array, considering a subarray that ends at `j`.
    2. For the subarray ending at `j`, start by taking arr[j] as the last (rightmost) element.
    3. Then extend the subarray backwards (to the left) one element at a time.
    4. For each new element arr[i] added to the left, its maximum allowed adjusted value is:
            min(arr[i], (adjusted value of next element) - 1)
       This enforces that the sequence is strictly increasing.
    5. If at any point the allowed adjusted value becomes 0 or negative, stop extending the subarray.
    6. Keep track of the sum of the adjusted subarray, updating the maximum sum found.
    
    Data Structures and Concepts:
    -----------------------------
    - Brute Force / Exhaustive Search: We try every possible subarray ending at each index.
    - Greedy Adjustment: Each element is adjusted to the maximum possible value without breaking the increasing order.
    - Early Termination: The inner loop stops when further extension is impossible (i.e., adjusted value â‰¤ 0).
