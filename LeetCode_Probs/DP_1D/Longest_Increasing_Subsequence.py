"""
Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "cat" is a subsequence of "crabt"

Example 1:
Input: nums = [9,1,4,2,3,3,7]

Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [1,2,3,7], which has a length of 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,3,1,3,2,3]

Output: 4
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000

Time Complexity Analysis
You start recursion from every index of nums, so you have O(N) recursive calls at the first level.
From each index, you recursively check all increasing elements to the right, leading to branching at each step.
The worst case occurs when each element is increasing, meaning you can make 2^N recursive calls in the worst case (each number either belongs to a subsequence or doesnâ€™t).
Thus, the time complexity is O(2^N), which is exponential.
