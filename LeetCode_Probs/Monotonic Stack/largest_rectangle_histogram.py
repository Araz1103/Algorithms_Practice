Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

Example 1:

      []
    [][]
    [][]
    [][]  []  
[]  [][][][]
[][][][][][]
 2 1 5 6 2 3

 5 and 6 rectangle makes up 10
 5 5 each is the largest rectangle

Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.
Example 2:

  []  
  []  
[][]
[][]
 2 4

2 and 2 combined here or 4 itself makes largest rectangle with area 4

Input: heights = [2,4]
Output: 4
"""

# Approach
# Basically we need to find the combinations of making all rectangles, and then return the one with the max area
# So for each bar in the histogram
# If we look to the left and keep finding bars >= length of that bar
# If we look to the right and keep finding bars >= length of that bar
# So the max area with this histogram is #neighbours on both directions >= this bar * height of this bar
# Also, count this bar itself too in this calculation, if there are no neighbours in either directions satisfying this

# Area = height[i] * (number of bars I can stretch to left + right + myself)

# So once we iterate through and find all areas, return the max of all of them!

# So basically I can do 1 iteration from left to right, finding the next lesser element
# And while I reach the next lesser element, I keep a track of the elements between them
# So that gives me an idea of -> Right area

# Then I do another iteration from right to left, finding the next lesser element
# Again, I keep track of elements between them
# So that gives me an idea of <- Left area

# Finally add both left and right for each, and that gives total, and the max of that is my answer!
# This is O(2*n) = O(n)

    Given a list of bar heights representing a histogram (where each bar has width = 1),
    this function returns the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed using 
    one or more consecutive bars.

    ✅ Intuition:
    For each bar, we want to compute:
    - How far left and right we can expand (i.e., consecutive bars that are ≥ current bar height).
    - Total width = left count + right count + 1 (the bar itself).
    - Area = height * total width.

    🧠 Key Idea:
    Use a monotonic increasing stack to efficiently find:
    - The number of consecutive bars to the RIGHT (Left-to-Right Pass)
    - The number of consecutive bars to the LEFT (Right-to-Left Pass)
    before hitting a shorter bar.

    🧱 How It Works:
    1. Left-to-Right pass:
       - For each index, find how many bars to the right are ≥ current bar.
       - Use a monotonic stack that maintains increasing heights.
    2. Right-to-Left pass:
       - Same idea, but in reverse direction to find left span.
    3. For each bar:
       - total_width = left_span + right_span + 1
       - area = height * total_width
    4. Return the maximum area across all bars.
