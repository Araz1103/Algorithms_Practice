"""
Generates all possible subsets (the power set) of a given list using backtracking.

Time Complexity:
- O(N Ã— 2^N), where:
    - 2^N is the number of subsets.
    - Each subset takes up to O(N) time to copy and append.

Space Complexity:
- Output storage (sub_sets): O(N Ã— 2^N)
    - We store 2^N subsets.
    - Each subset can be up to size N.
- Call stack: O(N), due to recursion depth.
- curr_set (temporary list used in recursion): O(N)
    - This is reused and does not add to total output space.

Key Notes:
- curr_set is dynamically modified (append/pop) in the recursion.
- curr_set is explicitly copied (`curr_set.copy()`) before adding to output to avoid referencing the same list object.
