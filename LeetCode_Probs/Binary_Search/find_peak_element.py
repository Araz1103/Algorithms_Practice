"""
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. 
If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. 
In other words, 
an element is always considered to be strictly 
greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 
where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.

# Intuition
# Since elements @end are always gt the out of bounds
# So we can always chase wherver the slope is increasing
# So 

#     |
#    ||   
#   |||

# If we consider above array
# We know that @end is the peak
# Now even if we landed somewhere else

#    |   
#    | |
#   |||||
#  ||||||
# Basically as long as we keep searching on side of increasing slope,
# We will land @peak
# So can do binary search O(Log(N))
# Basically check condition for slope
# Accordingly try searching left or right, wherever it is increasing
